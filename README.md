# Gratitude Journal

## Project Description

Gratitude Journal is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create, store, and share their daily gratitude entries. This smart contract enables users to maintain a permanent, immutable record of their gratitude moments while providing options for privacy and community engagement through a like system.

The contract provides a secure and transparent way to practice gratitude while building a supportive community where users can inspire each other with their positive reflections.

- **Build Community**: Foster a supportive environment where people can share and celebrate gratitude together
- **Promote Mental Health**: Encourage daily gratitude practice, which has been scientifically proven to improve mental well-being
